# My Ip

A Flutter app to show a phone's IP address when using it as a mobile hotspot. 

Troubled by having to visit the long path to the system settings to find the IP every time I wanted to debug a Flutter app wirelessly, this app was born. It reveals the IP on the fly.

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
